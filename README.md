# Camlin Technical Task

## Technologies/concepts involved

For the frontend:
* Vite
* React
* Typescript
* Antd
* Custom Hook to fetch data (useFetch), which is leveraging the generics typescript concept to accept and ensure its types
* ContextAPI is here to help us abstract and reuse some states across the application where necessary
* JSON Server mocking RestFul API, so we can make calls to the endpoints


## Setting Up & starting the webcomponents/json server applications

For the frontend, please guarantee you have node 20+ installed on your machine.

Please access the `camlin-technical-task` folder, which is the related project.
* Run `yarn install`
* Run `yarn run dev`
  * This command should start the react project (PORT=5178) and the json server (PORT=5179)
  * Frontend: http://localhost:5178/
  * JSON Server: http://localhost:5179/

## How does this work?

The purpose here is to quickly present the concept in a nutshell.

Work In Progress (Pending)

## Next steps

This section aims to express the points that are either missing, or should be implemented, for this project to function better.

* [ ] Implement skeleton, so when loading the new data, we can see it in a more friendly way
* [ ] Implement some unit tests
